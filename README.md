# Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on a single DGX Spark (GB10)

Run **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next** — a ~176B-parameter model (125B main + 51B n-gram, 6B
active) — on **one NVIDIA DGX Spark / ASUS GX10** with **vLLM**, at full prefill
speed, with MTP speculative decoding, **working prefix caching**, **deterministic
greedy decoding**, and up to **500k tokens of context**.

The catch this repo solves: the NVFP4 checkpoint is **122 GiB**, which does not fit
next to a usable KV cache in the Spark's **128 GB unified pool**. 44 GiB of that is
the n-gram embedding ("PLE") table — a pure lookup that a token only touches 16 rows
of. This repo patches the official vLLM image to **serve that table from NVMe via
`mmap`** instead of keeping it resident. Weights drop to **~76 GiB**, the rest of the
pool goes to KV, and everything runs on stock GB10 kernels.

Along the way it also fixes two things that were broken for this model on GB10 —
**prefix caching** (a vLLM block-size bug silently restored an all-zero Mamba state
on every cache hit) and **non-deterministic top-k in the sparse attention** (a GB10
kernel that drops candidates) — and offers an optional **hybrid** checkpoint layout
(NVFP4 experts + fp8 side layers) that decodes ~20% faster at the same quality.

## Update 2026-09-04 — what changed

If you cloned this before, here is the short version (details in the linked sections):

- **Prefix caching works now** — `--enable-prefix-caching` was crashing, then silently
  returning wrong answers on cache hits. Root cause was a vLLM block-size bug that made
  every prefix hit restore an *all-zero* Mamba state; two-line fix in the image. Getting
  there took [@Saren-Arterius](https://github.com/Saren-Arterius)'s pointer to
  vllm#50729 and their state-copy guard, and [@0xBakeer](https://github.com/0xBakeer)'s
  attempt to reproduce it, which sharpened the write-up.
  `PREFIX_CACHE=1` is the new default. Repeated prefixes (system prompts, multi-turn,
  tool loops) skip the prefill: ~14 s → ~1.4 s TTFT on a 20k-token prefix.
  → [Prefix caching now works](#prefix-caching-now-works-and-why-it-didnt)
- **Greedy decoding is deterministic now — at no prefill cost.** The GB10 sparse-attention
  top-k kernel was non-deterministic and dropped candidates, diagnosed and reported upstream by
  [@k3dani](https://github.com/k3dani) (issue #3, vllm#51782). First fixed with an exact
  `torch.topk` (deterministic but −20–40% on long prefill); now replaced by
  [@jschmied](https://github.com/jschmied)'s **deterministic kernel** (vllm#55122), compiled
  into the image: identical outputs at temperature 0 **and** full prefill speed back
  (32k: 1,794 → 2,904 tok/s). `DET_TOPK=1` is the default; `EXACT_TOPK=1` stays as a fallback.
  → [Deterministic top-k](#deterministic-top-k-det_topk1-default)
- **Optional M%4 padding for the fp8 GEMM** (`PAD_M4=1`, hybrid mode) — the image's blockwise-fp8
  kernel is up to 10× slower on chunks whose row count is not a multiple of 4; the padding is
  [@jschmied](https://github.com/jschmied)'s. With prefix caching on (default) chunks are already
  aligned and it changes nothing, so it is off by default; with `PREFIX_CACHE=0` it is worth about
  −40% TTFT at 8k. → [M%4 padding](#optional-m4-padding-for-the-fp8-gemm-pad_m41)
- **Two checkpoint modes** — `MODE=nvfp4` (as published) or `MODE=hybrid` (NVFP4 experts
  + fp8 side layers, one-time `scripts/prepare-hybrid.sh`): **+20% decode, +8% KV,
  same quality**. Our box runs the hybrid. The fp8 side-layer conversion and the
  original int4+fp8 dispatch it is ported from are
  [@Saren-Arterius](https://github.com/Saren-Arterius)'s. → [Two checkpoint modes](#two-checkpoint-modes-nvfp4-or-hybrid)
- **Also in the image**: vllm#50729 (Mamba state-copy race, by
  [@AndreasKaratzas](https://github.com/AndreasKaratzas)) + a bounds guard, the GB10 FLA
  fixes and the faster PLE gather from [@Saren-Arterius](https://github.com/Saren-Arterius)'s fork.
- **We benchmarked the int4 (Intel AutoRound) variant too** with the same patches:
  fastest raw decode, but not deterministic and slowest cached-TTFT, so we did not adopt
  it. Numbers in [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md#hybrid-mode-nvfp4-experts--blockwise-fp8-side-layers).
- **fp8 KV cache is available** (`KV_DTYPE=fp8_e4m3`), contributed by
  [@Nanetnounou](https://github.com/Nanetnounou): ×1.9 KV, 1M context on one box — at a
  speed and quality cost, so it is opt-in. → [fp8 KV cache](#optional-fp8-kv-cache-1m-context)
- `scripts/smoke-test.sh` now also checks the prefix-cache hit and determinism, and
  measures decode on a real answer instead of `ignore_eos` (which produces meaningless
  numbers with this model). `scripts/download-weights.sh` now forwards `HF_TOKEN`
  ([@wawimundo](https://github.com/wawimundo), PR #4).

Everything was measured on one ASUS GX10 with a 17-scenario agentic tournament (3 repeats
each), single-request speed benches on real prompts, and state checksums for the
prefix-caching work; nothing here is extrapolated.

| | llama.cpp IQ4_XS | **NVFP4 (this repo)** | **hybrid (this repo)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prefill | ~540 tok/s | **~2,400–2,900 tok/s** (deterministic kernel; warm page cache — a first pass over a cold region of the table reads from NVMe and can be 2–3× slower, see `PREWARM`) | same |
| Decode, single stream | ~22 tok/s (no MTP) | **~26 tok/s** with MTP=2 | **~31 tok/s** |
| Prefix-cache hit, TTFT on a 20k-token prefix | n/a | **~1.4 s** (vs ~14 s cold) | same |
| Context | 262k | **262k native, 500k with YaRN** | same |
| KV cache @0.80 (500k YaRN, MTP) | — | ~580k tokens | ~630k tokens |
| Deterministic at temperature 0 | yes | **yes** (`DET_TOPK=1`) | **yes** |

*Measured on an ASUS GX10 (GB10, 128 GB), single request, real prompts, greedy. Quality
(a 17-scenario agentic tournament, 3 repeats) is identical across NVFP4 and hybrid:
45/51 both, same two scenarios failed by every quantization we tried. Details and the
full comparison tables are in [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md).*

## Requirements

- An **NVIDIA DGX Spark or compatible GB10 (sm_121)** box, 128 GB unified memory,
  aarch64, recent NVIDIA driver, Docker with the NVIDIA container runtime.
- **~130 GB free disk** for the checkpoint (+13 GB for the hybrid variant), on
  reasonably fast storage (the table is read from it at runtime — NVMe strongly
  recommended; the Spark's onboard NVMe is ideal).
- The base image is multi-arch, so `docker build` also works on x86 Blackwell
  (sm_120, e.g. RTX PRO 6000) for testing, though this is tuned for the Spark.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blazux/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX.git
cd qwen3.8-Flash-DGX

docker build -t qwen38-flash-dgx .        # ~1 min: official image + the patches
scripts/download-weights.sh               # ~122 GiB, resumable (one-time)
scripts/serve.sh                          # NVFP4 mode, boots on :18300 (~8-13 min to load)
docker logs -f qwen38-flash               # wait for "Application startup complete"
scripts/smoke-test.sh                     # health, coherence, prefix-cache hit, determinism, tok/s
```

Then hit the OpenAI-compatible API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18300/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "model": "qwen3.8-flash-next",
  "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Write a haiku about a desktop supercomputer."}],
  "max_tokens": 512
}'
```

500k context (YaRN, validated with a needle-in-a-haystack at 414k tokens):

```bash
YARN=1 CTX=500000 GPU_MEM=0.80 scripts/serve.sh
```

## Two checkpoint modes: NVFP4 or hybrid

`scripts/serve.sh` serves one of two layouts of the same RadixArk NVFP4 checkpoint;
pick with `MODE=`.

| | `MODE=nvfp4` (default) | `MODE=hybrid` |
|---|---|---|
| Routed experts (the bulk, ~63 GiB) | NVFP4 | NVFP4 (unchanged) |
| GDN in/out projections, QSA q/k/v/o, shared experts (~15 GiB) | bf16, as published | **blockwise fp8-e4m3** (128×128 blocks, DeepSeek layout) |
| Extra preparation | none | `scripts/prepare-hybrid.sh` once (~10 min, +13 GB disk) |
| Decode (MTP=2, greedy, real answers) | ~26 tok/s | **~31 tok/s (+20%)** |
| Prefill | same | same (±5%) |
| KV cache | ~580k tokens | **~630k tokens (+8%)**, weights ~7 GiB smaller |
| Tournament quality (17 agentic scenarios × 3) | 45/51 | 45/51 |
| Deterministic at T=0 | yes | yes |
| Behavioural difference we noticed | — | slightly "more careful" in tool loops: it sometimes checks state first (one extra tool call), which is the only place it scored differently before we raised the turn budget |

Why it works: those side layers are dense and read in full on every decoded token, so
they dominate decode bandwidth; the experts are sparse (10 of 512 active) and already
4-bit. Halving the dense part is where the tokens/s come from. The MoE path — where
the quality lives — is untouched. Conversion uses
[@Saren-Arterius](https://github.com/Saren-Arterius)'s `fp8_convert.py` (worst
per-tensor max relative error 3.5%), and a small dispatch shim
(`src/vllm_fp8_hybrid_modelopt.py`) that routes those layers to vLLM's blockwise-fp8
GEMM while the ModelOpt NVFP4 config keeps handling the experts.

```bash
scripts/prepare-hybrid.sh                 # builds <snapshot>-fp8hybrid/ next to the HF snapshot
MODE=hybrid YARN=1 CTX=500000 GPU_MEM=0.80 scripts/serve.sh
```

Our own box runs the hybrid. If you want the checkpoint exactly as published, stay on
`MODE=nvfp4` — you lose ~5 tok/s and nothing else.

## Prefix caching now works (and why it didn't)

`--enable-prefix-caching` used to crash this model on GB10 (`CUDA illegal memory
access`) and, with a bounds guard in place, to **silently return different answers on
cache hits**. We traced it (details in [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md)):
vLLM's engine core overwrites `cache_config.block_size` with the *smallest* KV-group
block size — 8 tokens here with MTP=2 (4 without), the QSA raw-key ring — while the Mamba
state block is 1600 tokens. Two places used the former as the latter, so on a prefix hit
the worker computed the state slot as `(3200-1)//8 = 399` instead of `1`, read past the
block table row, and restored an **all-zero Mamba state**. The image carries a two-line fix;
with it, cold and cache-hit outputs are bit-identical (state checksums and first-token
logprobs match exactly) and the tournament score is unchanged.

What you get: multi-turn chats, agent/tool loops and shared system prompts skip the
prefill of everything already seen. On a 20k-token prefix, TTFT goes from ~14 s to
~1.4 s; with 8 concurrent conversations, from ~80 s to ~4–6 s. `PREFIX_CACHE=1` is the
default. Mamba states are cached at 1600-token boundaries, so the tail of a prefix is
recomputed — expect the benefit to start around a couple of thousand tokens.

## Deterministic top-k (`DET_TOPK=1`, default)

The sparse attention (QSA) picks the top-k key blocks per query with a `persistent_topk`
kernel. On GB10 that kernel is **non-deterministic** — identical greedy requests produce
different outputs 2 times out of 4 — and can drop legitimate candidates
([vllm#51782](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/51782)); reported against
this repo by [@k3dani](https://github.com/k3dani) in
[issue #3](https://github.com/blazux/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/issues/3). The GB10 is more
exposed than other GPUs: the cooperative kernel used elsewhere for decode is disabled on
sm_12x, so this kernel runs for both prefill and decode.

Two fixes are in the image; the second is the default:

- **`DET_TOPK=1` (default) — deterministic kernel.** [@jschmied](https://github.com/jschmied)
  rewrote `persistent_topk` so that output slots are index-ordered and exact ties are resolved
  without candidate buffers (no truncation, exact pivot) — upstream as
  [vllm#55122](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/55122). The Dockerfile compiles it
  with the image's `nvcc` as a standalone extension (`_C_det.so`, ~15 s on a GX10, no vLLM
  rebuild) from his repo at a pinned commit, and an env-gated switch routes the QSA block
  selection to it. Measured on the GX10 (hybrid, MTP=2, prefix caching): **4/4 prompts stable,
  first-token logprobs identical to the 4th decimal**, and speed at kernel level — decode
  32.5 tok/s, prefill 2,436 tok/s at 8k / 2,904 at 32k, needle 92k in 48 s — i.e. the same as
  the stock non-deterministic kernel.
- **`EXACT_TOPK=1` — exact `torch.topk` fallback.** Our first fix: also deterministic and same
  tournament score, but −8% prefill at 8k and −20–40% at 32k+ (decode unchanged). Kept as a
  fallback (it wins over `DET_TOPK` when set), e.g. on a GPU where the kernel is not built.
- `DET_TOPK=0 EXACT_TOPK=0` gives the stock kernel back.

Once vllm#55122 is merged into the release branch this image is built from, patch 8 becomes
redundant. (Masking the never-written logits columns before the stock kernel does **not**
restore determinism, so it is the kernel itself.)

## Optional: M%4 padding for the fp8 GEMM (`PAD_M4=1`)

Hybrid mode runs the GDN/QSA side layers and shared experts through vLLM's blockwise-fp8
cutlass GEMM. On this image (sm_12x) that kernel routes any call whose row count M is not a
multiple of 4 (or ≤ 64) to a `swap_ab` path that is much slower — upstream fixed it in C++
([vllm#52775](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/52775)) after the image was cut.
[@jschmied](https://github.com/jschmied) found it and wrote a drop-in that pads M to a
multiple of 4 inside an opaque custom op (`fp8_m4pad_patch.py`, patch 9 in the Dockerfile,
fetched at a pinned commit; issue #3).

Measured on the GX10 at the kernel level (K=4096, N=8192): ×1.7 below 2,048 rows
(0.63 → 1.09 ms at M=1,601), **×10–11 above** (0.87 → 9.6 ms at M=2,401); padding restores the
aligned time in every case. At the server level it depends on how the scheduler cuts prefill
chunks:

- **`PREFIX_CACHE=1` (default): no-op.** The Mamba align mode clips every prefill chunk to the
  1,600-token block boundary, so M % 4 == 0 on all large chunks. Same-session A/B on the hybrid
  (MTP=2): 8k 3.33 → 3.24 s, 32k 11.63 → 10.97 s, salted repeats within noise, and prompts built
  to leave a misaligned last chunk (8,801 / 8,803 tokens) showed no penalty either. Off by default.
- **`PREFIX_CACHE=0`: use it.** Chunks are then whatever the batch size leaves (an 8,001-token
  prompt is one 8,001-row chunk); @jschmied measured −40% TTFT at 8k and −10–15% at 30k on the
  stock image, and the unpatched kernel is bimodal (2.9–6.6 s at 8k depending on the cut).

`PAD_M4=1` also sets `VLLM_FP8_PAD_M4=1`; `scripts/serve.sh` always passes the variable because
the patch itself defaults to on when it is unset. NVFP4 mode does not use this GEMM.

## Tuning (env vars for `scripts/serve.sh`)

| Var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MODE` | `nvfp4` | `hybrid` = fp8 side layers (see above; needs `scripts/prepare-hybrid.sh`). |
| `PREFIX_CACHE` | `1` | `--enable-prefix-caching`. Correct with this image (block_size fix). |
| `DET_TOPK` | `1` | Deterministic QSA top-k **kernel** (vllm#55122): identical outputs at T=0 at full kernel speed. `0` = stock kernel (non-deterministic, may drop attention candidates, issue #3). |
| `EXACT_TOPK` | `0` | `1` = exact `torch.topk` fallback (deterministic; −8% prefill at 8k, −20–40% at 32k+). Wins over `DET_TOPK` when set. |
| `PAD_M4` | `0` | `1` = pad M%4 in the blockwise-fp8 GEMM (hybrid mode). No-op with `PREFIX_CACHE=1`; about −40% TTFT at 8k with `PREFIX_CACHE=0`. |
| `PORT` | `18300` | API port |
| `CTX` | `262144` | Max context. Native is 262144; with `YARN=1` up to `500000` is validated. |
| `YARN` | `0` | `1` = YaRN rope scaling (factor 4, Qwen's recipe) for `CTX` > 262144. |
| `SEQS` | `8` | Max concurrent sequences. **Do not benchmark with 1–2**: excess requests queue silently and aggregate tok/s flatlines (see below). |
| `GPU_MEM` | `0.85` | Fraction of the 128 GB pool for weights+KV. **For long-running service use `0.80`** (as in the Quickstart): `0.875` got OOM-killed on a 300k-token prefill with MTP, and after a day at `0.85` the box drifted into swap. The lower you set it, the more RAM the page cache has for the 48 GiB table — which is what your prefill speed depends on (below). Right after stopping another big container the first boot can fail with "13.5 GiB KV cache is needed, larger than available" — memory not yet released; the `unless-stopped` retry succeeds. |
| `MTP` | `2` | Speculative tokens from the model's MTP head (`0` = off). |
| `KV_DTYPE` | `auto` | `auto` = bf16 (recommended). `fp8_e4m3` = ~1.9× KV pool, 1M context on one box, at −10% decode / −30% prefill and a measurable quality cost — see [fp8 KV cache](#optional-fp8-kv-cache-1m-context) before using it. |
| `PREWARM` | `0` | `1` streams the 48 GiB table once at boot to warm the page cache — steadier first-request latency, ~10 s extra startup. |
| `WORKERS` | `32` | Threads used for the mmap gather (only used above `VLLM_PLE_MMAP_FAST_ROWS`=512 unique rows; decode-sized gathers run inline). |
| `EXTRA` | | Extra vLLM flags, passed verbatim. |

## Throughput and concurrency

Single-stream numbers understate this model on a GB10. @jschmied traced one box
under load (RadixArk NVFP4, 8k ctx, **no** speculative decoding, using vLLM's native
PLE CPU offload rather than this repo's mmap — the table-serving cost behaves the
same way) and found aggregate throughput scales far past single-stream:

| concurrent streams | aggregate tok/s | per stream | major faults / token | TTFT |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 17.1 | 17.1 | 16.0 | 0.22 s |
| 8 | 87.5 | 10.9 | 7.0 | 0.53 s |
| 16 | 131.6 | 8.2 | 9.6 | 0.83 s |
| 32 | 212.0 | 6.6 | 4.3 | 1.19 s |
| 48 | **266.8** | 5.6 | 3.6 | 1.60 s |

Two things worth knowing (their words, lightly condensed):

- **The paged table is an argument *for* concurrency, not against it.** Page-fault cost
  per token *falls* 4.4× from c=1 to c=48: batched tokens share n-gram rows and the
  page cache keeps the hot set, so the marginal token is far cheaper than the first.
  The table gather itself never exceeded ~25% of one CPU core.
- **A low `--max-num-seqs` is indistinguishable from saturation if you only look at
  tok/s.** With `--max-num-seqs 2` their sweep flatlined at ~33 tok/s while
  `vllm:request_queue_time_seconds_sum` climbed to 142 s. Check `max-num-seqs` before
  quoting an aggregate number — this repo's default is now `8` for that reason.

Method and harness: [load-and-waits.md](https://github.com/jschmied/qwen38-flash-next-gb10/blob/main/notes/load-and-waits.md).

## How it fits — the one idea

A token's n-gram lookup reads **16 rows × 160 bytes ≈ 2.5 KB**. Over a 20k-token
prefill that's ~1.3 GB of small reads — under a second on NVMe, and the hot n-grams
stay in the page cache. So the 44 GiB table never needs to be in the unified pool:
we `mmap` the checkpoint's `model-plefp8-*.safetensors` shards and gather rows on
demand. Nothing else about the model changes — the hashing, dequant, and the sparse
attention all run stock.

Full details, including the GB10-specific bugs this works around and the long-context
findings, are in [docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md).

### GB10 kernel fixes and the faster gather (contributed)

From [@Saren-Arterius](https://github.com/Saren-Arterius)'s fork, merged here with thanks:

- **FLA shared-memory gate** — sm_121 reports 99 KiB of shared memory per block but the
  flash-linear-attention gate asked for 100 KiB, so all 36 GDN layers silently ran on
  small tiles. One `sed` in the Dockerfile lowers the gate to 99 KiB.
- **`chunk_delta_h` `num_warps` pin** — works around a `tl.dot` race on Blackwell
  ([fla#953](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/issues/953)). Correctness, not speed.
- **PLE gather hot path** — CPU dedup of row ids, a persistent pinned staging buffer with an
  async H2D copy, GPU-side expansion through the inverse index, and an inline fast path
  for decode-sized batches (`VLLM_PLE_MMAP_FAST_ROWS`, default 512). Also: bf16/f16 tables,
  `VLLM_PLE_MMAP_DIR` to serve the table from another directory, and a periodic
  `PLE mmap stats` log line (`VLLM_PLE_MMAP_STATS_SEC`, default 30).
- **Mamba state-copy guard** — with [vllm#50729](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/50729)
  (the overlapping-copy race fix by @AndreasKaratzas), a bounds check that turns an
  out-of-range block id into a skipped copy plus a log counter instead of a dead CUDA
  context. With the block_size fix above the counter stays at 0; if you ever see
  `mamba state-copy guard: N out-of-range`, something upstream regressed — please report it.
- **`fp8_convert.py`** — the side-layer conversion behind `MODE=hybrid`.

Their fork goes further with an **int4 (Intel AutoRound) + fp8 hybrid** checkpoint:
[qwen3.8-Flash-DGX-AutoRound](https://github.com/Saren-Arterius/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX-AutoRound).
We benchmarked it with the same patches: ~34 tok/s decode, 44/51 on the tournament,
but it is not deterministic even with the exact top-k and Marlin's atomic adds off, and
it has the slowest prefill of the three — we kept the NVFP4-based layouts.

### Alternative: vLLM's native PLE CPU offload

vLLM ships its own path (`VLLM_PLE_CPU_OFFLOAD=1`) that keeps the table in pinned host
RAM in a separate worker process. On a Spark that RAM is the same pool as the GPU, so
it saves less than the mmap — but @jschmied got it running and documented two things
you will need if you go that way (neither applies to the mmap patch, which is a single
process):

1. `_get_ple_embedding_quant_method()` in `ple_layer.py` only accepts `Fp8Config`;
   with the NVFP4 checkpoint the quant config is `modelopt_fp4`, so the FP8 PLE shards
   are rejected and loading dies on `ngram_embedding.weight_scale`. Accepting
   `modelopt`/`modelopt_fp4` there fixes it.
2. The worker hands CUDA tensors to the GPU process over IPC via `pidfd_getfd`, which
   `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=1` (the Ubuntu/DGX OS default) forbids between sibling
   processes. In Docker: `--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE`. Under systemd:
   `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_SYS_PTRACE`. It fails ~10 minutes in, after all shards
   have loaded, with an unhelpful `Engine core initialization failed`.

## Limitations & notes

- **One big model at a time.** At `GPU_MEM=0.85` this uses most of the 128 GB pool;
  don't co-locate another large model (an 8B embedding model next to it already
  starves the KV cache — we moved ours to another machine).
- **Full `torch.compile` is off** (an Inductor int64-indexing assert on sm_121); the
  serve script uses PIECEWISE CUDA graphs with the PLE lookup as a splitting op.
- **1M context** needs the fp8 KV cache (`KV_DTYPE=fp8_e4m3`, see above), which costs
  speed and some quality; in bf16 a single 1M request needs ~26 GiB of KV and 500k with
  YaRN is the validated ceiling (800k booted but got OOM-killed on a long prefill).
- **Exact top-k costs prefill** on long prompts (see above). The implementation is a
  plain `torch.topk` over the full visible width per chunk; a fused kernel would recover
  most of it — PRs welcome.
- **Weights are not included** and the checkpoint carries Qwen's license (with a
  MAU/revenue clause) — review it before production use.
